Our correspondent gathered that Achimugu was arrested around 5am shortly after her return from London.
Achimugu had been declared wanted in March by the EFCC over allegations of criminal conspiracy and money laundering.
On Monday, the Federal High Court in Abuja, presided over by Justice I.E. Ekwo, had ordered her to appear before the EFCC on Tuesday, and also to appear before the court on Wednesday, April 30, 2025.  




Her lawyer, Chief Chikaosolu Ojukwu, confirmed her arrest in a message to our correspondent, saying, “Aisha Achimugu, who arrived voluntarily into the country from London, was arrested by the EFCC around 5 a.m. on Tuesday.”
Ojukwu criticised the EFCC’s action, describing it as a violation of a court order.  Related News  Followers excited as Oyedepo’s ex-VP starts new church  Gender advocates hail death sentence for late Osinachi’s husband  Court adjourns arraignment of Ponzi syndicate for alleged N3.5bn fraud

Secondly, the court said she must appear before us today. We were not restricted from arresting her; what the court said was if she comes, she should not be detained.
“How are you sure she would appear before us today? Now that we have seen her, we have a course to ensure she appears.”

Punch Nigeria,"Murder: I didn’t report Ataga’s death due to fear, says Chidinma",https://punchng.com/murder-i-didnt-report-atagas-death-due-to-fear-says-chidinma/,"Most Widely Read Newspaper Chidinma Ojukwu Kindly share this story: Chidinma Ojukwu, a 300-level student of the University of Lagos, who is standing trial for the alleged murder of Super TV Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ataga, on Monday, told a Lagos State High Court that she did not report the incident to the police because she was afraid.
Chidinma, in her defence before Justice Yetunde Adesanya at the Lagos State High Court sitting at Tafawa Balewa Square, explained that she feared being wrongly accused if she reported the crime.
“I had read of incidents where people reported crimes and ended up being accused themselves,” she said.
“I also thought of calling the gateman again while I was at the staircase of the apartment, but I ended the call out of fear.”  




The defendant was also charged with stealing and forgery alongside one Adedapo Quadri and her sister, Chioma Egbuchu.
They were arraigned on October 12, 2021, on a nine-count charge preferred against her.
The defendant who opened her case on April 17, 2025, narrated the events that followed the discovery of Ataga’s lifeless body.        
Chidinma gave a detailed account of her activities from June 16 to 23, 2021.
Led in evidence by her counsel, Onwuka Egwu, the defendant recounted that on June 16, 2021, she noticed that a WhatsApp message she had sent earlier to Ataga had been read and that his status was showing “online,” even though she had seen him lying motionless in a pool of blood.
She said she attempted to call his number several times, but the calls were declined. “I was confused. I asked myself if someone else had his phone,” she said.
Chidinma testified that she contacted the gateman known as Abu, who usually handled utilities at the short-let apartment.
When she asked him if he had seen Ataga, she said he replied that Ataga had left the previous day. However, the gateman later informed her that Ataga’s car was still parked at the property.
“Judging by what Abu told me, I said to myself, what have I done? I then sent a WhatsApp message to Michael saying, ‘Please forgive me. I didn’t mean to leave you in that state. I was very scared.’ After that, I was blocked from the number and couldn’t reach him again,” she said.
Chidinma stated that she had two laptops, one Macbook and one HP laptop, and on June 18, 2021, she took them to Computer Village, one for sale and the other for repair.     
She said that when she got to the vendor, whom she normally purchased from, and gave him the Macbook, for sale, the vendor asked her for the receipt.
“I said it was a gift from last December 2020, and then the manager entered and asked me to unlock the Macbook laptop so that he could check very well.
“Then I unlocked the laptop, they checked whatever they wanted to check and then asked me how much I wanted to sell. I said N600,000, we negotiated then it got sold for N495,000. He then asked me to sign out of the i-cloud, I signed out and the money was transferred into my bank account, and then I took the HP laptop for repair.”
The defendant also described events on June 19 and 20, 2021, stating that she attempted to reach Ataga through SMS due to a poor network connection.
Chidinma told the court that on June 20, 2021, she spoke with her sister, Chioma (the third defendant), and invited her over.

Chioma, who was in the eastern part of the country at the time, visited her on June 22, 2021.
According to Chidinma, Chioma had misplaced her phone in April when she travelled to the East.        
Since she had two phones: an iPhone 11, and an iPhone 7, she gave her an iPhone 7 Plus she had used the previous year.
She testified that she was arrested by the police on June 23, 2021.
Chidinma, who denied having Ataga’s property, claimed that one of the officers slapped her, but her father intervened.
She said they were both handcuffed and taken to the police station at Panti.
“At the DCP’s office, I told him I didn’t know about the death. I said I ran out of fear and took my things. My father was also handcuffed. The DCP said he was interfering with the officers’ work,” she recounted.
She further told the court that the police later took them to her residence, where they recovered her phones, laptop, a black disposable bag containing clothes, some documents from the apartment, and ID cards.
Chidinma alleged that she was then taken to a smaller room where her left hand was handcuffed to a chair.     
She said an officer identified as Bamidele brought a blank statement form and asked her to write a statement.
“I told him I knew my rights and that a lawyer should be present. He said no lawyer was coming, and no one would be allowed to see me,” she claimed.
She further alleged that Bamidele threatened her, saying her family members, including her 10-year-old sister, could be detained if she did not cooperate.
“Because of what he said, I started writing,” she said.
After writing her statement, Ojukwu said Bamidele tore it up and demanded a new version.
He allegedly showed her graphic images from the crime scene and claimed that a robe recovered from the apartment was used to tie the deceased’s hands, an allegation she denied.
“I told him I couldn’t have tied Michael up. He was a huge man,” she said.  
She said the officer also questioned her possession of various documents, including her UNILAG ID card, bank statements, and voter’s card, to which she replied that she was a student and had processed the documents legally.
Justice Adesanya adjourned the matter till April 29, 2025, for the continuation of the hearing.

When she asked him if he had seen Ataga, she said he replied that Ataga had left the previous day. However, the gateman later informed her that Ataga’s car was still parked at the property.
“Judging by what Abu told me, I said to myself, what have I done? I then sent a WhatsApp message to Michael saying, ‘Please forgive me. I didn’t mean to leave you in that state. I was very scared.’ After that, I was blocked from the number and couldn’t reach him again,” she said.
Chidinma stated that she had two laptops, one Macbook and one HP laptop, and on June 18, 2021, she took them to Computer Village, one for sale and the other for repair.     
She said that when she got to the vendor, whom she normally purchased from, and gave him the Macbook, for sale, the vendor asked her for the receipt.
“I said it was a gift from last December 2020, and then the manager entered and asked me to unlock the Macbook laptop so that he could check very well.
“Then I unlocked the laptop, they checked whatever they wanted to check and then asked me how much I wanted to sell. I said N600,000, we negotiated then it got sold for N495,000. He then asked me to sign out of the i-cloud, I signed out and the money was transferred into my bank account, and then I took the HP laptop for repair.”
The defendant also described events on June 19 and 20, 2021, stating that she attempted to reach Ataga through SMS due to a poor network connection.
Chidinma told the court that on June 20, 2021, she spoke with her sister, Chioma (the third defendant), and invited her over.

Chioma, who was in the eastern part of the country at the time, visited her on June 22, 2021.
According to Chidinma, Chioma had misplaced her phone in April when she travelled to the East.        
Since she had two phones: an iPhone 11, and an iPhone 7, she gave her an iPhone 7 Plus she had used the previous year.
She testified that she was arrested by the police on June 23, 2021.
Chidinma, who denied having Ataga’s property, claimed that one of the officers slapped her, but her father intervened.
She said they were both handcuffed and taken to the police station at Panti.
“At the DCP’s office, I told him I didn’t know about the death. I said I ran out of fear and took my things. My father was also handcuffed. The DCP said he was interfering with the officers’ work,” she recounted.
She further told the court that the police later took them to her residence, where they recovered her phones, laptop, a black disposable bag containing clothes, some documents from the apartment, and ID cards.
Chidinma alleged that she was then taken to a smaller room where her left hand was handcuffed to a chair.     
She said an officer identified as Bamidele brought a blank statement form and asked her to write a statement.
“I told him I knew my rights and that a lawyer should be present. He said no lawyer was coming, and no one would be allowed to see me,” she claimed.
She further alleged that Bamidele threatened her, saying her family members, including her 10-year-old sister, could be detained if she did not cooperate.
“Because of what he said, I started writing,” she said.
After writing her statement, Ojukwu said Bamidele tore it up and demanded a new version.
He allegedly showed her graphic images from the crime scene and claimed that a robe recovered from the apartment was used to tie the deceased’s hands, an allegation she denied.
“I told him I couldn’t have tied Michael up. He was a huge man,” she said.  
She said the officer also questioned her possession of various documents, including her UNILAG ID card, bank statements, and voter’s card, to which she replied that she was a student and had processed the documents legally.
Justice Adesanya adjourned the matter till April 29, 2025, for the continuation of the hearing.
                                             “I also thought of calling the gateman again while I was at the staircase of the apartment, but I ended the call out of fear.”  




The defendant was also charged with stealing and forgery alongside one Adedapo Quadri and her sister, Chioma Egbuchu.
They were arraigned on October 12, 2021, on a nine-count charge preferred against her.
The defendant who opened her case on April 17, 2025, narrated the events that followed the discovery of Ataga’s lifeless body.        
Chidinma gave a detailed account of her activities from June 16 to 23, 2021.
Led in evidence by her counsel, Onwuka Egwu, the defendant recounted that on June 16, 2021, she noticed that a WhatsApp message she had sent earlier to Ataga had been read and that his status was showing “online,” even though she had seen him lying motionless in a pool of blood.

Chidinma told the court that on June 20, 2021, she spoke with her sister, Chioma (the third defendant), and invited her over.

Chioma, who was in the eastern part of the country at the time, visited her on June 22, 2021.
According to Chidinma, Chioma had misplaced her phone in April when she travelled to the East.        
Since she had two phones: an iPhone 11, and an iPhone 7, she gave her an iPhone 7 Plus she had used the previous year.
She testified that she was arrested by the police on June 23, 2021.
Chidinma, who denied having Ataga’s property, claimed that one of the officers slapped her, but her father intervened.
She said they were both handcuffed and taken to the police station at Panti.
“At the DCP’s office, I told him I didn’t know about the death. I said I ran out of fear and took my things. My father was also handcuffed. The DCP said he was interfering with the officers’ work,” she recounted.
She further told the court that the police later took them to her residence, where they recovered her phones, laptop, a black disposable bag containing clothes, some documents from the apartment, and ID cards.
Chidinma alleged that she was then taken to a smaller room where her left hand was handcuffed to a chair.     
She said an officer identified as Bamidele brought a blank statement form and asked her to write a statement.
“I told him I knew my rights and that a lawyer should be present. He said no lawyer was coming, and no one would be allowed to see me,” she claimed.
She further alleged that Bamidele threatened her, saying her family members, including her 10-year-old sister, could be detained if she did not cooperate.
“Because of what he said, I started writing,” she said.
After writing her statement, Ojukwu said Bamidele tore it up and demanded a new version.
He allegedly showed her graphic images from the crime scene and claimed that a robe recovered from the apartment was used to tie the deceased’s hands, an allegation she denied.
“I told him I couldn’t have tied Michael up. He was a huge man,” she said.  
She said the officer also questioned her possession of various documents, including her UNILAG ID card, bank statements, and voter’s card, to which she replied that she was a student and had processed the documents legally.
Justice Adesanya adjourned the matter till April 29, 2025, for the continuation of the hearing.
                                             She said she attempted to call his number several times, but the calls were declined. “I was confused. I asked myself if someone else had his phone,” she said.
Chidinma testified that she contacted the gateman known as Abu, who usually handled utilities at the short-let apartment.
When she asked him if he had seen Ataga, she said he replied that Ataga had left the previous day. However, the gateman later informed her that Ataga’s car was still parked at the property.
“Judging by what Abu told me, I said to myself, what have I done? I then sent a WhatsApp message to Michael saying, ‘Please forgive me. I didn’t mean to leave you in that state. I was very scared.’ After that, I was blocked from the number and couldn’t reach him again,” she said.
Chidinma stated that she had two laptops, one Macbook and one HP laptop, and on June 18, 2021, she took them to Computer Village, one for sale and the other for repair.     
She said that when she got to the vendor, whom she normally purchased from, and gave him the Macbook, for sale, the vendor asked her for the receipt.
“I said it was a gift from last December 2020, and then the manager entered and asked me to unlock the Macbook laptop so that he could check very well.
“Then I unlocked the laptop, they checked whatever they wanted to check and then asked me how much I wanted to sell. I said N600,000, we negotiated then it got sold for N495,000. He then asked me to sign out of the i-cloud, I signed out and the money was transferred into my bank account, and then I took the HP laptop for repair.”

Chioma, who was in the eastern part of the country at the time, visited her on June 22, 2021.
According to Chidinma, Chioma had misplaced her phone in April when she travelled to the East.        
Since she had two phones: an iPhone 11, and an iPhone 7, she gave her an iPhone 7 Plus she had used the previous year.
She testified that she was arrested by the police on June 23, 2021.
Chidinma, who denied having Ataga’s property, claimed that one of the officers slapped her, but her father intervened.
She said they were both handcuffed and taken to the police station at Panti.
“At the DCP’s office, I told him I didn’t know about the death. I said I ran out of fear and took my things. My father was also handcuffed. The DCP said he was interfering with the officers’ work,” she recounted.
She further told the court that the police later took them to her residence, where they recovered her phones, laptop, a black disposable bag containing clothes, some documents from the apartment, and ID cards.
Chidinma alleged that she was then taken to a smaller room where her left hand was handcuffed to a chair.     
She said an officer identified as Bamidele brought a blank statement form and asked her to write a statement.
“I told him I knew my rights and that a lawyer should be present. He said no lawyer was coming, and no one would be allowed to see me,” she claimed.
She further alleged that Bamidele threatened her, saying her family members, including her 10-year-old sister, could be detained if she did not cooperate.
“Because of what he said, I started writing,” she said.
After writing her statement, Ojukwu said Bamidele tore it up and demanded a new version.
He allegedly showed her graphic images from the crime scene and claimed that a robe recovered from the apartment was used to tie the deceased’s hands, an allegation she denied.
“I told him I couldn’t have tied Michael up. He was a huge man,” she said.  
She said the officer also questioned her possession of various documents, including her UNILAG ID card, bank statements, and voter’s card, to which she replied that she was a student and had processed the documents legally.
Justice Adesanya adjourned the matter till April 29, 2025, for the continuation of the hearing.
                                             The defendant also described events on June 19 and 20, 2021, stating that she attempted to reach Ataga through SMS due to a poor network connection.

Punch Nigeria,Afenifere blames rising terrorism on foreign interests,https://punchng.com/afenifere-blames-rising-terrorism-on-foreign-interests/,"Most Widely Read Newspaper A Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere logo Kindly share this story: Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, on Monday, lamented the growing wave of terrorism across Nigeria, particularly in the North-East, North-Central, and North-West regions.
In a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, Afenifere attributed the surge in terrorist activities to a combination of factors, including ungoverned spaces, porous borders, the proliferation of weapons, complicity of state actors and influential individuals, sabotage, foreign interests, and illegal mining.
The organisation further blamed ethnic groups’ quest for territorial dominance, instability in Sahel countries, farmer-pastoralist conflicts, a growing army of uneducated youths, particularly in the North, and socio-economic issues such as high unemployment, weak state presence, and a rising culture of wealth acquisition at any cost.
“In identifying the root causes of insecurity, it is clear that wide expanses of ungoverned land, porous northern borders, the proliferation of weapons, and weak institutional capacity all play critical roles,” Ajayi said.  




He added that elements of sabotage by unscrupulous politicians, ethno-religious bigotry, and ineffective governance had worsened the situation.
Citing a January 2025 statement by the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Christopher Musa, and a recent claim by Benue State Governor, Hyacinth Alia, Ajayi said there was credible evidence that foreign interests were fueling terrorism in Nigeria.
“There have been consistent reports linking foreign elements, particularly from Mali, to attacks on Nigerian soil,” he noted.        
The PUNCH reports that recent banditry and terror attacks have rocked Plateau, Benue, Niger, Borno, Katsina, Zamfara, and Kwara states, resulting in substantial loss of lives and property worth billions of naira.

Afenifere highlighted Nigeria’s poor governance, particularly at the state and local government levels, as a major enabler of terrorism.
Quoting the Queer Ladder Theory, the group stated, “Organised crimes thrive where the government’s ability to sanction and deter is weak, where public corruption is endemic, and where legitimate livelihood opportunities are slim.”
On the growing number of uneducated youths in the North, Afenifere warned that terror groups were increasingly recruiting from this vulnerable population.
“As many as 30,000 bandits were reportedly active in the North-West as far back as 2010. Despite security efforts, this number has swelled due to the mass of uneducated, unskilled youths,” Ajayi said, echoing Chief Obafemi Awolowo’s warning that the failure to educate the poor would eventually disrupt societal peace.
Afenifere linked the growing frustration among youths to the psychological principle known as “Frustration-Aggression Theory,” noting that when promises fail to materialise, vulnerable youths often resort to violence.
Meanwhile, the group paid tribute to its former leader, the late Senator Abraham Adesanya, who died on April 27, 2008, describing him as a “titan of conscience, courage, and unyielding patriotism.”     
In a separate statement signed by Afenifere’s Organising Secretary, Kole Omololu, the group lauded Adesanya’s legacy:
“A beacon of progressive thought and an unrelenting advocate for true federalism, Senator Adesanya’s life embodied a profound devotion to justice, liberty, and national equity. In an era of dictatorship and democratic subversion, he stood as a lone voice of moral authority, galvanising a generation yearning for a Nigeria governed by fairness and reason.”
