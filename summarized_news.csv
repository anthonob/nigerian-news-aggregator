In a statement on Monday via Facebook, Obigwe urged Ndi Anambra and other voters in the state to reelect Soludo and reject “desperate politicians” whom he accused of using “sugar-coated words and empty promises” to deceive the people. He specifically declared that the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Nicholas Ukachukwu, is no match for Soludo and will face an imminent defeat at the poll. He said, “There is no vacancy in Anambra State Government House. The majority of Anambra’s populace testify that no governor in the state’s history has achieved what Soludo’s administration has in three years. One million Ukachukwus cannot unseat him. “We are predicting a ‘walkover’ for Soludo; his administration’s achievements, including infrastructure and security improvements, are testament to that. “Anambra is in safe hands under Soludo, and voters will reject ‘desperate politicians’ who are using ‘sugar-coated words and empty promises’ to deceive the people.”  Kindly share this story:  All rights reserved.

Punch Nigeria,ASUP slams rectors over trade union act misinterpretation,https://punchng.com/asup-slams-rectors-over-trade-union-act-misinterpretation/,"Most Widely Read Newspaper ASUP logo Kindly share this story: The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics has accused the Committee of Federal Rectors of meddling in union affairs through what it described as a deliberate misinterpretation of the Trade Union Act.
Addressing a press conference in Offa, Kwara State on Monday, the zonal coordinator, ASUP ZONE C, Dr Masopa Nurudeen, said that the recent directive issued by COFER on April 17, 2025, asking rectors of federal polytechnics to enforce a disputed interpretation of the Trade Union Act (2006), was not only wrong, but showed a disregard for responsibilities and limits.
“The Trade Union Act has been operational since 2006 for all trade unions, including those in universities, polytechnics, and Colleges of Education. It is unfortunate that COFER, which is not a statutory body, is now attempting to interpret the law in a manner that undermines unionism”, the union stated.
ASUP also said that COFER, a subset of polytechnic heads, under the umbrella of COHEAD, lacked supervisory, regulatory, or legal authority to interpret laws, describing their action as meddlesome and baseless.  




“They forget that the staff members are employees of the federal government, and consent to union membership was obtained during the IPPIS enrollment. COFER’s move shows ignorance of basic industrial relations principles,” the union said.
ASUP, which said that the rectors involved are themselves federal employees and members of ASUP, which according to the union, disqualified them from dictating union affairs.  Related News  NBTE allays ASUP’s concerns over accreditation outsourcing  NBTE defends outsourcing of physical accreditation amid ASUP concerns  ASUP rejects outsourcing of poly accreditation   
“The idea of asking staff to submit fresh written consent is laughable and bereft of common sense. Consent was already given expressly and impliedly by staff through their IPPIS enrollment and long-standing union membership,” they added.        
The union particularly condemned the role of the Rector of the Federal Polytechnic, Offa, describing his action as a betrayal.
Similarly, the attitude of rectors of Federal Polytechnics Ekowe, Nekede, and Bida were condemned for allegedly attempting to weaken the union’s influence due to ASUP’s stance against unethical practices.
The union, which warned that it would resist any attempt to diminish its role in protecting workers’ rights in the polytechnic sector, said that, “Any individual or group that seeks to undermine our efforts will be met with stiff resistance. We are committed to safeguarding the rights and welfare of our members at all costs.”
The ASUP demanded immediate withdrawal of COFER’s directive and an apology, saying that it would use legal and industrial means to protect its integrity and membership.

Punch Nigeria,"NLNG unveils new scheme, pledges $1,300 each to 50 Rivers beneficiaries",https://punchng.com/nlng-unveils-new-scheme-pledges-1300-each-to-50-rivers-beneficiaries/,"Most Widely Read Newspaper Kindly share this story: The NLNG has unveiled an economic empowerment scheme known as VIBES aimed at enhancing entrepreneurial knowledge and growing small businesses within its over 110 host and pipeline communities in Rivers State.
The company said the strategy formerly known as Youth Empowerment Scheme now focuses on the sustainability of small businesses owned and managed by previous YES beneficiaries.
It said under the new program, each participant in the top 50 will receive a grant of $1,300 to boost their businesses and other benefits.
Speaking at the relaunch event in Port Harcourt on Monday, the  General Manager, External Relations and Sustainable Development, Dr Sophia Horsfall, said VIBES stands for Vocational, Innovation, Business, and Empowerment Scheme.  




She stated, “NLNG believes that entrepreneurship is not just about starting and running a business, it is about creating opportunities that uplift the communities to drive economic growth and spark positive social change.
“In line with NLNG’s vision of improving lives sustainably, VIBES is a deliberate programme to engender entrepreneurial knowledge, and the networks needed to grow entrepreneurs and change-makers in our communities.”
Dr. Horsfall, who was represented at the event by Charles Epelle, Manager of Community Relations and Sustainable Development, said that over 1,400 youths from NLNG’s host and pipeline communities in Rivers State had been trained in 10 different empowerment programs since the inception of YES in 2004.        
She said this has been achieved, though fewer than 300 are said to be operating viable businesses to date.
The crafts include Automotive, Advanced welding, Catering and Hotel Management, Fashion Design and Cosmetology, Farm Management, Information and Communication Technology as well as Photography and Video Production.

Dr Horsfall added, “We believe that VIBES will foster an environment where individuals can create businesses, generate employment, and become innovators.
“This belief drives our commitment to nurturing local capacity and enabling individuals to become creators of jobs, wealth, and lasting impact.”
Speaking further, she said the programme is a modern approach to economic empowerment which “offers enhanced support through networking opportunities, grants, resources, and mentorship to help participants refine and scale up their ideas.”
In conceptualizing VIBES, the NLNG said it assembled experts in entrepreneurship, business development, law, technology, and innovations, and several other fields for the continued training and mentorship of select business operators to ensure the continued survival, growth, and sustainability of such businesses.
She further said IBES will provide comprehensive business training, which includes courses on financial management, marketing, strategic planning, law, legal practices, and more.     
“It shall also provide personalized advisory services and structured mentorship from seasoned business professionals to the participants.
“Beneficiaries will be administered professional, practical, participative training designed to build robust technical and managerial capacity.
“Participants in the top 50 will receive a grant of $1,300 each, disbursed in two tranches. This funding is intended to help upscale business and as part of a broader support system that includes mentorship, networking, and additional advisory services.”
                                             The company said the strategy formerly known as Youth Empowerment Scheme now focuses on the sustainability of small businesses owned and managed by previous YES beneficiaries.
It said under the new program, each participant in the top 50 will receive a grant of $1,300 to boost their businesses and other benefits.
Speaking at the relaunch event in Port Harcourt on Monday, the  General Manager, External Relations and Sustainable Development, Dr Sophia Horsfall, said VIBES stands for Vocational, Innovation, Business, and Empowerment Scheme.  




She stated, “NLNG believes that entrepreneurship is not just about starting and running a business, it is about creating opportunities that uplift the communities to drive economic growth and spark positive social change.
“In line with NLNG’s vision of improving lives sustainably, VIBES is a deliberate programme to engender entrepreneurial knowledge, and the networks needed to grow entrepreneurs and change-makers in our communities.”
Dr. Horsfall, who was represented at the event by Charles Epelle, Manager of Community Relations and Sustainable Development, said that over 1,400 youths from NLNG’s host and pipeline communities in Rivers State had been trained in 10 different empowerment programs since the inception of YES in 2004.        
She said this has been achieved, though fewer than 300 are said to be operating viable businesses to date.
The crafts include Automotive, Advanced welding, Catering and Hotel Management, Fashion Design and Cosmetology, Farm Management, Information and Communication Technology as well as Photography and Video Production.

Dr Horsfall added, “We believe that VIBES will foster an environment where individuals can create businesses, generate employment, and become innovators.
“This belief drives our commitment to nurturing local capacity and enabling individuals to become creators of jobs, wealth, and lasting impact.”
Speaking further, she said the programme is a modern approach to economic empowerment which “offers enhanced support through networking opportunities, grants, resources, and mentorship to help participants refine and scale up their ideas.”
In conceptualizing VIBES, the NLNG said it assembled experts in entrepreneurship, business development, law, technology, and innovations, and several other fields for the continued training and mentorship of select business operators to ensure the continued survival, growth, and sustainability of such businesses.
She further said IBES will provide comprehensive business training, which includes courses on financial management, marketing, strategic planning, law, legal practices, and more.     
“It shall also provide personalized advisory services and structured mentorship from seasoned business professionals to the participants.
“Beneficiaries will be administered professional, practical, participative training designed to build robust technical and managerial capacity.
