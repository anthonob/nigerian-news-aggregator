# Nigerian News Aggregator üì∞

This is a simple live Nigerian News Aggregator app built with Streamlit.

It fetches the latest headlines from major Nigerian newspapers (Punch, Guardian, Vanguard), summarizes them using AI, and displays the summarized news in a simple, clean web app.

## How It Works

- Summarized news headlines are saved to `summarized_news.csv`.
- The Streamlit app (`news_app.py`) reads the CSV and displays the news.
- The app is lightweight and fast, making it ideal for quick browsing.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas

## Live Demo

üöÄ Coming Soon: [Streamlit Cloud Deployment](https://share.streamlit.io/) (once deployed)

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Install required packages:

3. Run the Streamlit app:
